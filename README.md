# About

This is a project I made for college as a completion for C course. It's written in pure C. I used a lot of deprecated functions which I shouldn't have used but it was my first time. I might update this project later if needed. This project also makes use of JSON as txt files to save the data.

These are tasks which can be done by the application.
